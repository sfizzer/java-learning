# Java SE 9
The newest release of Java is Java SE 9. The developer’s kit is called JDK 9. With
the release of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase9-archive-downloads.html">JDK 9</a>, the internal version number is also 9. JDK 9 represents a major
Java release, incorporating significant enhancements to both the Java language and
its libraries. Like the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-javase5-downloads.html">JDK 5</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html">JDK 8</a> releases, JDK 9 affects the Java language and
its API libraries in fundamental ways.
The primary new feature is modules, which enable you to specify the relationship
and dependencies of the code that comprises an application. Modules also add
another dimension to Java’s access control features. The inclusion of modules caused
a new syntax element and several keywords to be added to Java. Furthermore, a tool
called jlink was added to the JDK, which enables a programmer to create a run-time
image of an application that contains only the necessary modules. A new file type,
called JMOD, was created. Modules also have a profound affect on the API library
because, beginning with JDK 9, the library packages are now organized into modules.
